# 🐰  Howdy!
🇫🇷
#### 🎮 I'm all about embracing the chaos, whether it's mastering my skills or diving into esports. I have a soft spot for VS Fighting and League of Legends—there's something exhilarating about those pixelated brawls! When I'm not in the midst of action, you'll find me immersed in the captivating worlds of Detective Conan and Great Teacher Onizuka. Exploring solo indie games is my go-to for unwinding—a quiet adventure to escape the chaos of the day. 🌟

#### 🐾  I'm a total animal lover, always finding joy in their company. On the side, I'm dreaming of serenading the world with a saxophone someday. 🎷

## 💻 Welcome to the Clown Fiesta:
### Currently riding the Python and Go rollercoasters, navigating the wild, untamed jungles of DevOps. 🤡
#### 🕵️‍♂️ I could be a nocturnal vampire 🧛, a wise owl 🦉, or maybe a blend of both for midnight snacks. 🌑 (Sunlight and garlic? Nah, not my style.)
